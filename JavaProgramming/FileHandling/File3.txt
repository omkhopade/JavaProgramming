The 65-year-old had a history of breathing illnesses, and he had also suffered a heart attack in 2013.
So he got tested for coronavirus immediately. The result was positive.
His family rushed him to the government hospital in their home town of Katihar in the northern state of Bihar. The doctor advised them to take him home, which surprised his son, Vishal.
He told the doctor that his father had recovered from severe pneumonia last year, and was at higher risk. But the advice remained unchanged.
Even as the family arranged an oxygen cylinder at home, Vishal began contacting other hospitals. None had beds available.
Over the next 24 hours - as Mr Singh's blood oxygen level kept falling - Vishal got through to a government hospital that had an ICU bed free.
